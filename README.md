# This is a home task for white circle

## Launching the project.
- Updated env.local variables
- run the command `npm run dev`

## What can be improved
The task is not done in ideal way:
- Conversation List and Messages components are not done with virtualized lists.
- Not all things are covered in claude skill to help with development.
- i18n can be added.
- api needs to be split in case if there will be many endpoints.
- PII is done in MVP version. I am doing such task for the first time, so I don't know the best way to solve it.
- There can be some bugs in conversations.
- No mobile support.
